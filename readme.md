## Overview

**Project Title**:
D20_Roller_Generator

**Project Description**:
Have this program roll numbers between 1-20 with the user's desired modifier
then add it to the generated roll. Prior to this generated roll + the modifer
the user will tell the program how many times they want to roll which will
then be stored in an array. After the roll and the addition, user will put in 
another integer signifying the Armor class or number that will be constested
against all of the rolls. The program will then count how many times the user's
roll has beat the modifier. Then display the array of rolls and the number of times
the Armor class has been beaten by the user's rolls.

**Project Goals**:
Finish this project in it's entirety.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Create a hello world file using VS Community
2. Run the program in make usre it works.
3. Create the fucntions each of the prompts.
4. Turn said fuctions into variables in main.
5. Create function for creating array.
6. Create function for computation.
7. Create fuctnion for counting the number of hits.
8. Put it all together in main.

Instructions for using the software:

1. The program asks how big the array is.
2. The program asks for the modifier.
3. The program will ask for the Armor Class

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* VS Community
* The vector library
* cstdlib library for random

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I wll add damage rolls using a similar function layout.
* [ ] I will also add the total of damage rolls and display them. 
* [ ]
